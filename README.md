# Sales Prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts the sales based on advertising data. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about advertising spend on TV, radio, and newspaper for various products, along with the corresponding sales.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called "Advertising.csv" and contains 200 observations with 4 features: TV, radio, newspaper, and sales. The target variable is sales, and the other variables are the advertising spends for TV, radio, and newspaper.

# Methodology
We have used a regression model to predict the sales based on the advertising spend. We have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and preprocess the data for model training. We have used Decision Tree Regression machine learning algorithm to build the regression model

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Results
We have evaluated the performance of the model using accuracy_score. The final model has an accuracy_score of 0.96. This indicates that the model has a good fit and can predict the sales accurately.

# Usage
To use the model, you can input the advertising spends for TV, radio, and newspaper into the trained model, and it will predict the sales based on the input.
